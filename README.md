## introduction

I recently removed a bunch of internals in order to be able to publish this,
hence there is still some patching to be done before we call this "released".

I would say v2.5 will have all old features.

## TODO

* move documentation from our internal wiki here
* make the tests init a little easier
* lots of eyes now plz
